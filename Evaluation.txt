Testing of Classes:



Unfortunately not all classes have been tested.

The following classes have been subject to partial testing:

(1) BinarySearchTree<T>
(2) BookLoan
(3) BookType
(4) Date
(5) MemberType

The following classes have NOT been tested!

(6)  BooksLoader
(7)  DataManip
(9)  LibSystem
(10) LoansLoader
(11) MembersLoader
(12) ReadCsv

The following classes are abstract and so cannot be directly tested,
although some of their methods, eg getKey() have been tested in derived
classes like BookType and BookLoan.

(13) Searchable
(14) SimpleBinaryTree<T>

Summary of Unit Testing:



BinarySearchTree<T>::GetNodeValue() fails it's unit test... I believe this is a

problem with the BookType assignment operator override.

More thorough unit testing of this class is required.




The BookType assignment operator override unit test PASSES when I set

one of the authors to a different value, in a comparison of (otherwise identical) objects.

This should make the test fail, but it still passes.  So there is something wrong.

But it is not preventing the main program from running.


All other tests passed ok.

THE EXECUTABLE PROGRAM



Things that work:

	
The required menu functions all work, and the system saves its data to text

files when it is shut down, so that next time the program starts, the data is loaded.




Things that do not work:


Borrowing any given book will make all other copies of that book unavailable,

as though ALL copies had been borrowed. This is not a bug, but a design fault:

there is no facility to check out a single volume: cardinality of BookLoans to

BookTypes is 1..1

Instead - there should be zero-or-many BookLoans for any given BookType.

This would need to be fixed in future versions of the program.
